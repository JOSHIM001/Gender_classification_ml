## 📁 Files Included

- `gender_classification.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with the full ML pipeline
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset `gender_classification_v7.csv` contains features used to classify gender.  
It is included in this repository for easy access and testing.

Example features: height, weight, voice pitch, etc. *(Adjust based on actual features)*

## 🧠 ML Workflow

1. **Import Libraries & Load Data**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize/scale features
3. **Split Dataset** into train/test sets using `train_test_split`
4. **Train ML Models**
   - Fit and predict using 6 different algorithms
5. **Evaluate Performance**
   - Use `accuracy_score`, `confusion_matrix`, and `classification_report`
6. **Visualizations**
   - Heatmaps of confusion matrices
   - Graphviz tree visualization
